# camera_features

A flutter plugin that returns to you the features of the device camera.

## Getting Started
This plugin only returns a array with the info about the device cameras. You can use that
to know if the camera have some feature that you need. Unfortunately I didn't find a way that you can
pass the fields that you want, so you will have to copy the return and put on a notepad
to filter for what you want. 
If you want to know what fields the plugin returns, just take a look at

Suggestions will always be welcome.
